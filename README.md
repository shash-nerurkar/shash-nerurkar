### Hi there 👋

<p align='justify'>
    I'm Shashank! I am a twenty-two year old game developer from Gujarat, India. You may also know me as StashAtStake, Civilian_Archetype, M1Abhrahams.
    <br />
    Technical stuff: I am between jobs. My last job was as a Mobile Applications developer in Zignuts Technolabs. I have been developing software professionally for 2 years.

            A video game called Gaatha
        </li>
        <li>
            Another video game called Unnamed
        </li>
    </ul>
<br/>

🌱 I’m currently learning ...

        </li>

    <ul align='justify'>
        <li>
            perfecting my projects! I cannot work on things I don't love. Therefore, I love what I work on. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sub><sup>girlfriend</sup></sub>

        <li>
            getting into an active gaming corporation. I have been developing video games with my friends for a long time now. Often, me and my friends fall short in             certain modules of our games. To imagine that work having the maturity (and more) that I see in the modules that we are good at, gives me shivers. I am excited at               the prospect of working in a real environment with professionals and learning from them the ins and outs of the game dev world.
